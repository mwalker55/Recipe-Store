#Recipe Store
This is a program created in Java for my grandma to serve the purposes of the IBSL Computer Science internal assessment.

##Purpose
The purpose of this program is to provide an easy way for users to enter their physical recipes into their computer.

The recipes are saved in a computer-readable format to a text document where they can then later be read, edited and deleted.

##Limitations
Due to the limitations of the IBSL Computer Science internal assessment, certain data structures (like lists) that would have made the code smoother could not be used.

##Running
To run this, simply create a Java project consisting of the 4 .JAVA files and run it.
